## Course aims

* To introduce students to the principles, techniques and methods of distributed computing in sufficient breadth and depth for it to act as a foundation for the exploration of specific topics in more advanced course units. 
* The course unit assumes that students have already a solid understanding of the main principles of computing within a single machine, and that they have a rudimentary understanding of the issues related to machine communication and networking.
