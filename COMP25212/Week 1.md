* Computing tech trends, challenges & some solutions
* Rapid increase of processing power
* Slow increase of memory access capability
* Memory wall
* Solution: **Caches**, out of order execution, prefetching, compiler optimisations, etc.
* No silver bullet...


Core concepts behind caches:



Test:

* Cache behaviour
* Parameters
* Limits

Learn:

* How the cache works
* How memory accesses are handled
* What inhibits the cache's behaviour

Understand:

* Importance of caches
* How to avoid inefficient patterns
* How to write, optimise programs
* How cache is structured
* How it operates (CPU reads, CPU writes0
* Key cache performance parameters
* Making cache more efficient
