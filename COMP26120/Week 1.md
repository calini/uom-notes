## Trees
- Non empty set of nodes
- Has a root
- Each node that's not the root has a parent node (ancestor)
- A node may have children (descendents)
- If nodes have the same parent, they are *siblings*

## Ordered trees
- A binary tree = ordered tree in which each node has at most 2 children
- Proper binary tree = exactly zero/two children for each node.
