# Trees

* Non empty set of nodes
* Has a root
* Each node that's not the root has a parent node (ancestor)
* A node may have children (descendents)
* If nodes have the same parent, they are *siblings*

## Ordered trees

* A binary tree = ordered tree in which each node has at most 2 children
* Proper binary tree = exactly zero/two children for each node.
